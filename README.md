Cooking utility for people who cannot count

This is a quick project I made during Programming 2 / Java course at University of Trento.

It allows the user to add and remove ingredients in specified quantities to and from a list, to then convert said quantities. The quantities can be converted by entering how many people the original recipe is for and how many people one needs to cook for.

The app consists of a Java program that uses JavaFX for its front-end. **As such, you need to import JavaFX to use the program**
